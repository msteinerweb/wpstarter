# WPStarter

A WordPress starter heavily inspired by [WordPressify](https://www.wordpressify.co/).


Requirements:
 - [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
 - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
 - [wp-cli](https://wp-cli.org/)


## Setup
 1. Update `config.js` with your own settings.
 2. Run `npm run wpinstall` to install WordPress.
 3. Run `npm run dev` to being developing.
 4. Once finished, run `npm run build` to build your theme.

I'll fill out the rest later...
